Not only it caters for running of an organization on successful business, it also paves the way to achieve its’ goal, as a natural culmination of activities.\"\n\nIt further states that HR policy:\n\n* Focuses on employees to have clear expectations on work requirements, compensation, welfare, and career development\n* Sets clear and specific standards, procedures, and a framework to spot and address deviations and violations of these standards\n* Eliminates adhocism on employees’ related issues\n* Provides direction in the growth of the organization in general, and management of employees in particular\n* Enables clarity and norming of practices on various issues related to HR management\n* Works as a guide to standardization on various aspects of quality services, skill development, and performance appraisal through system and processes.\n\nOverall, the HR policy provides a detailed layout of format for best practices in human resource development, enabling a healthy work environment and promoting faith in HR practices for required consideration for compensation and promotions.
